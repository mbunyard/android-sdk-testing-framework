[UI Testing](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_ui.html)
"UI testing ensures that your application returns the correct UI output in response to a sequence
of user actions on a device, such as entering keyboard input or pressing toolbars, menus, dialogs,
images, and other UI controls."

[Unit Tests](http://developer.android.com/training/activity-testing/activity-unit-testing.html)
"A unit test generally tests the smallest possible unit of code (which could be a method, class,
or component), without dependencies on system or network resources. For example, you can write a
unit test to check that an Activity has the correct layout or that it triggers an Intent object
correctly."

[Functional Tests](http://developer.android.com/training/activity-testing/activity-functional-testing.html)
"Functional testing involves verifying that individual application components work together as
expected by the user. For example, you can create a functional test to verify that an Activity
correctly launches a target Activity when the user performs a UI interaction."
